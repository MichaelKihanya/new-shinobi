### The New Shinobi Code
To live by "The New Shinobi Code", one does not do so loudly, with social media posts, or telling friends and family. Practicing "The New Shinobi Code" is an internal practice. A practice of reflection. A practice of goodness. To ultimately better one's life and those in it.
### Quote
`Through our scientific and technological genius, we've made of this world a neighborhood. And now through our moral and ethical commitment, we must make of it a brotherhood. We must all learn to live together as brothers—or we will all perish together as fools.` - Martin Luther King Jr.
